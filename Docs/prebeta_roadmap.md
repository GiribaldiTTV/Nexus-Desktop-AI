# Nexus Pre-Beta Roadmap

## Purpose

This document is the sequencing and release-posture layer for current Nexus `pre-Beta` planning.

Use it for:

- latest public prerelease truth
- release-debt posture
- current sequencing posture
- recently closed milestone context

Do not use it as:

- a second backlog
- a workstream execution diary
- a substitute for canonical workstream records

## Authority And Boundaries

This roadmap is subordinate to:

- `Docs/development_rules.md`
- `Docs/phase_governance.md`
- `Docs/codex_modes.md`
- `Docs/feature_backlog.md`
- `Docs/workstreams/index.md`
- `Docs/closeout_guidance.md`

That means:

- backlog owns identity
- workstream docs own promoted-work feature-state, branch-local evidence, and closure records
- phase governance owns repo-wide lifecycle, proof, timeout, and stop-loss rules
- closeouts and rebaselines own epoch summaries
- roadmap owns sequencing and release posture only

## Lane Types And Release Fields

Use these lane types:

- `docs-only`
- `implementation`
- `rebaseline`

Use these release-floor values:

- `no release`
- `patch prerelease`
- `minor prerelease`

Use these release-state values when relevant:

- `active delta`
- `merged unreleased`
- `released`
- `closed`

## Current Release Posture

Current merged truth indicates:

- latest public prerelease: `v1.6.0-prebeta`
- latest public release commit: the `v1.6.0-prebeta` tag target
- latest public prerelease publication: `https://github.com/GiribaldiTTV/Nexus-Desktop-AI/releases/tag/v1.6.0-prebeta`
- latest public prerelease title: `Pre-Beta v1.6.0`
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: yes
- the latest public released implementation milestone is FB-040 monitoring, thermals, and performance HUD surface in `v1.6.0-prebeta`
- current phase after FB-031 merge-target canon: `Release Readiness`
- phase status after FB-031 merge-target canon: `No Active Branch`
- blocker after FB-031 merge: release debt remains until `v1.6.1-prebeta` is tagged and published
- current active workstream: none
- current branch after FB-031 merge: `No Active Branch`
- merged-unreleased release-debt owner: FB-031 Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX overhaul planning
- next concern: run FB-031 Release Readiness from inherited release target, release scope, release artifacts, and post-release truth without file mutation after PR merge.

That means the released FB-027 interaction baseline, the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone, the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone, the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone, the released FB-038 tray quick-task UX milestone, the released FB-039 external trigger intake architecture milestone, and the released FB-040 monitoring/thermal architecture milestone are now part of the current public shared pre-Beta baseline.

## Current Release Debt Owner

### FB-031 Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX Overhaul Planning

- status: `Merged Unreleased`
- record state: `Promoted`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-031_nexus_desktop_ai_ui_ux_overhaul_planning.md`

Merged-Unreleased Release-Debt Owner: FB-031 Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX overhaul planning
Repo State: No Active Branch
Release Target: v1.6.1-prebeta
Release Floor: patch prerelease
Version Rationale: FB-031 is architecture-only UI/UX planning and implementation-admission canon with no executable, runtime, operator-facing, user-facing, or materially expanded product capability; per governance, architecture-only planning/admission work uses patch prerelease advancement from v1.6.0-prebeta to v1.6.1-prebeta.
Release Scope: Architecture-only Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX source map, visual-language ownership vocabulary, lifecycle and interaction-state framing, future UI implementation admission contract, hardening pressure test, Live Validation repo-truth and waiver classification, and PR Readiness merge-target canon.
Release Artifacts: Tag v1.6.1-prebeta; release title Pre-Beta v1.6.1; inclusion-only release notes summarize the FB-031 UI/UX architecture milestone, source-map and lifecycle/state boundaries, validation/admission contract, hardening result, Live Validation waivers, and clean branch history.
Post-Release Truth: FB-031 becomes Released / Closed in v1.6.1-prebeta; release debt clears; repo remains No Active Branch until FB-032 Branch Readiness admission is explicitly opened.
Selected Next Workstream: FB-032 Nexus-era vision and source-of-truth migration
Next-Branch Creation Gate: FB-032 remains selected-only with Branch: Not created until FB-031 release debt clears and updated main revalidates Branch Readiness admission.

## Current Active Workstream

None. FB-031 merge-target canon resolves to merged-unreleased release debt and `No Active Branch` until `v1.6.1-prebeta` release handling clears the debt.

## Selected Next Workstream

### FB-032 Nexus-era Vision And Source-Of-Truth Migration

- Record State: `Registry-only`
- Minimal Scope: Branch Readiness must define the Nexus-era vision/source-of-truth migration boundary, current-vs-historical naming policy, AI/UI identity routing, canon migration admission rules, and explicit non-goals before any wording migration, persona work, runtime behavior, UI implementation, rebrand execution, or release work is considered.
- Branch: Not created.
- Creation Gate: Branch creation is deferred until FB-031 release debt clears and updated `main` revalidates Branch Readiness admission.

## Most Recent Released Workstream Context

### FB-040 Monitoring, Thermals, And Performance HUD Surface

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `minor prerelease` (historical published tag; future architecture-only planning/admission milestones must not use minor solely because they define a planning lane)
- target version: `v1.6.0-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.6.0`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-040_monitoring_thermals_performance_hud_surface.md`
- sequencing note: released the architecture-only monitoring and thermal planning milestone, including source map, ownership vocabulary, lifecycle/trust-safety framing, validation/admission contract, hardening result, and Live Validation waiver handling.
- version-governance note: FB-040 was already published as `v1.6.0-prebeta`; governance now records that future architecture-only, non-user-facing planning/admission milestones default to patch prerelease advancement unless they deliver a runtime, executable, or user-facing capability lane.

## Current Sequencing Reading

Current merged truth indicates:

- the released FB-027 baseline remains part of the locked current interaction floor
- the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-038 tray quick-task UX milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-039 external trigger intake architecture milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-035 lane is closed
- the recent released workstreams above remain part of the locked current baseline
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: yes; FB-031 is the merged-unreleased release-debt owner until `v1.6.1-prebeta` release handling clears the debt
- FB-038 is released and closed in `v1.4.1-prebeta`; H1 identity/discoverability repair, H2 shortcut-launch tray readback validation, H3 window initialization sequencing, H4 post-fix startup visibility validation, fresh post-H4 technical/live validation, user-facing desktop shortcut validation, and UTS waiver digestion are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-039 is released and closed in `v1.5.0-prebeta`; internal-only intake runtime boundaries, reusable validation coverage, Live Validation waivers, PR readiness governance, and post-merge release-truth repairs are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-040 is released and closed in `v1.6.0-prebeta`; architecture-only monitoring and thermal source mapping, lifecycle/trust-safety framing, validation/admission contract, hardening, Live Validation waiver truth, and post-release canon closure are preserved as historical evidence
- post-release repo truth after the FB-040 release was clear; FB-031 merge-target truth now creates merged-unreleased release debt for `v1.6.1-prebeta`
- FB-031 is the merge-target release-debt owner after PR merge; repo state resolves to `No Active Branch` until release handling clears the debt
- successor-lane branch creation for FB-039 is historical; FB-039 is released and no longer an executable active implementation branch
- if a branch changes release-facing canon, those canon updates must land on that same branch before PR readiness is allowed
- escaped post-merge canon repair must ride a legal branch surface; `main` is protected and must not be patched directly by Codex
- the released FB-027 baseline does not authorize further saved-action authoring, resolution, voice, Action Studio, routines, profiles, hotkey cleanup, or shutdown-confirmation work by inertia
- remaining future candidate spaces now explicitly recorded in the backlog include:
  - FB-038 for taskbar or tray quick-task UX including Create Custom Task, now released and closed in `v1.4.1-prebeta` with H3/H4 startup visibility re-entry green, `User-Facing Shortcut Validation: PASS`, and UTS handling resolved by documented waiver
  - FB-039 for external trigger and plugin integration architecture, now released and closed in `v1.5.0-prebeta`
  - FB-040 for monitoring, thermals, and performance HUD surfaces, released and closed in `v1.6.0-prebeta`
  - FB-031 for Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX overhaul planning, merge-target complete as the `v1.6.1-prebeta` release-debt owner after PR merge
  - FB-032 for Nexus-era vision and source-of-truth migration, selected next with Branch: Not created until FB-031 release debt clears and updated main revalidates Branch Readiness admission
- those candidate lanes must be selected deliberately rather than bundled together as one implicit interaction continuation
- FB-037 Branch Readiness does not imply automatic continuation into any remaining candidate lane

# Nexus Pre-Beta Roadmap

## Purpose

This document is the sequencing and release-posture layer for current Nexus `pre-Beta` planning.

Use it for:

- latest public prerelease truth
- release-debt posture
- current sequencing posture
- recently closed milestone context

Do not use it as:

- a second backlog
- a workstream execution diary
- a substitute for canonical workstream records

## Authority And Boundaries

This roadmap is subordinate to:

- `Docs/development_rules.md`
- `Docs/phase_governance.md`
- `Docs/codex_modes.md`
- `Docs/feature_backlog.md`
- `Docs/workstreams/index.md`
- `Docs/closeout_guidance.md`

That means:

- backlog owns identity
- workstream docs own promoted-work feature-state, branch-local evidence, and closure records
- phase governance owns repo-wide lifecycle, proof, timeout, and stop-loss rules
- closeouts and rebaselines own epoch summaries
- roadmap owns sequencing and release posture only

## Lane Types And Release Fields

Use these lane types:

- `docs-only`
- `implementation`
- `rebaseline`

Use these release-floor values:

- `no release`
- `patch prerelease`
- `minor prerelease`

Use these release-state values when relevant:

- `active delta`
- `merged unreleased`
- `released`
- `closed`

## Current Release Posture

Current merged truth indicates:

- latest public prerelease: `v1.6.2-prebeta`
- latest public release commit: `e282072769ec25694928293ce51e144d6a37f611`
- latest public prerelease publication: `https://github.com/GiribaldiTTV/Nexus-Desktop-AI/releases/tag/v1.6.2-prebeta`
- latest public prerelease title: `Pre-Beta v1.6.2`
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: no
- the latest public released implementation milestone is FB-032 Nexus-era vision and source-of-truth migration in `v1.6.2-prebeta`
- current phase after FB-032 release closure: `Branch Readiness`
- phase status after FB-032 release closure: FB-004 Branch Readiness blocker-clearing canon closure is in progress; no FB-004 implementation is admitted yet
- blocker after FB-032 release: release debt is clear; FB-004 still must complete Branch Readiness before promotion, implementation, or Workstream admission
- current active workstream: none; FB-004 remains selected-only and registry-only until Branch Readiness completes
- current branch after FB-032 release: `feature/fb-004-future-boot-orchestrator-layer`
- selected next workstream: FB-004 Future boot orchestrator layer
- next concern: complete FB-004 Branch Readiness after FB-032 post-release canon closure validates.

That means the released FB-027 interaction baseline, the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone, the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone, the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone, the released FB-038 tray quick-task UX milestone, the released FB-039 external trigger intake architecture milestone, the released FB-040 monitoring/thermal architecture milestone, the released FB-031 UI/UX architecture milestone, and the released FB-032 source-of-truth migration milestone are now part of the current public shared pre-Beta baseline.

## Current Release Debt Owner

Merged-Unreleased Release-Debt Owner: None.
Repo State: FB-004 Branch Readiness blocker-clearing seam on `feature/fb-004-future-boot-orchestrator-layer`; no active promoted workstream until Branch Readiness completes.

Latest Public Prerelease: v1.6.2-prebeta
Latest Public Release Commit: e282072769ec25694928293ce51e144d6a37f611
Latest Public Prerelease Publication: https://github.com/GiribaldiTTV/Nexus-Desktop-AI/releases/tag/v1.6.2-prebeta
Latest Public Prerelease Title: Pre-Beta v1.6.2
Release Debt: Clear after FB-032 release execution and live release validation.
Post-Release Truth: FB-032 is Released / Closed in v1.6.2-prebeta; release debt is clear; FB-004 may continue Branch Readiness after updated-main revalidation and the repo-level admission gate passes.
Selected Next Workstream: FB-004 Future boot orchestrator layer
Next-Branch Creation Gate: FB-004 Branch Readiness branch now exists only for blocker-clearing canon closure and Branch Readiness planning; FB-004 remains selected-only and registry-only until Branch Readiness completes.
Current active workstream: none
Current Active Workstream Before Release: FB-032 Nexus-era vision and source-of-truth migration
Active Branch Before Release: `feature/fb-032-nexus-era-vision-source-of-truth-migration`

## Current Active Workstream

No promoted active workstream is admitted. FB-004 remains selected-only and registry-only until Branch Readiness completes.

## Latest Released Workstream Context

### FB-032 Nexus-Era Vision And Source-Of-Truth Migration

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.6.2-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.6.2`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-032_nexus_era_vision_and_source_of_truth_migration.md`
- sequencing note: released the architecture-only Nexus-era source-of-truth migration foundation, including current-vs-historical source inventory, naming policy, canonical-vs-historical surface classification, controlled migration admission contract, governance repairs, hardening, Live Validation waivers, and PR Readiness merge-target canon.
- successor note: FB-004 is selected next and now has the Branch Readiness branch `feature/fb-004-future-boot-orchestrator-layer`, but remains selected-only until Branch Readiness completes.

## Selected Next Workstream

### FB-004 Future Boot Orchestrator Layer

- status: `deferred / selected next`
- record state: `Registry-only`
- priority: `High`
- selection basis: priority-led backlog selection; FB-004 is a High-priority open candidate with deferred-context fields present, while FB-029 is also High but requires explicit product/legal approval before selection.
- branch: `feature/fb-004-future-boot-orchestrator-layer`
- minimal scope: define the smallest implementation-facing boot-orchestrator Branch Readiness plan above the desktop launcher, including boot-to-desktop ownership, non-goals, validation proof path, rollback boundary, and explicit protection against runtime delivery by inertia.
- creation gate: branch creation is complete for the blocker-clearing Branch Readiness surface only; FB-004 remains selected-only and registry-only until Branch Readiness defines the branch objective, target end-state, seam families, validation contract, User Test Summary strategy, later-phase expectations, and first admitted Workstream seam.

## Prior Released Workstream Context

### FB-031 Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX Overhaul Planning

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.6.1-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.6.1`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-031_nexus_desktop_ai_ui_ux_overhaul_planning.md`
- sequencing note: released the architecture-only UI/UX planning milestone, including source map, visual-language ownership vocabulary, lifecycle and interaction-state framing, future UI implementation admission contract, Hardening pressure test, Live Validation waivers, PR Readiness merge-target canon, and PR-R1 release-floor validator repair.
- successor note: FB-032 is released and closed in `v1.6.2-prebeta`; FB-004 is selected next and remains Branch Readiness-only until its admission plan is complete.

## Prior Released Workstream Context

### FB-040 Monitoring, Thermals, And Performance HUD Surface

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `minor prerelease` (historical published tag; future architecture-only planning/admission milestones must not use minor solely because they define a planning lane)
- target version: `v1.6.0-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.6.0`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-040_monitoring_thermals_performance_hud_surface.md`
- sequencing note: released the architecture-only monitoring and thermal planning milestone, including source map, ownership vocabulary, lifecycle/trust-safety framing, validation/admission contract, hardening result, and Live Validation waiver handling.
- version-governance note: FB-040 was already published as `v1.6.0-prebeta`; governance now records that future architecture-only, non-user-facing planning/admission milestones default to patch prerelease advancement unless they deliver a runtime, executable, or user-facing capability lane.

### FB-039 External Trigger And Plugin Integration Architecture

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `minor prerelease`
- target version: `v1.5.0-prebeta`

- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.5.0`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-039_external_trigger_plugin_integration_architecture.md`
- sequencing note: released the internal-only external trigger intake architecture milestone, including source map, ownership vocabulary, lifecycle/trust framing, in-memory registration, bounded invocation follow-through, lifecycle transitions, decision evidence, boundary state snapshots, readiness inspection, registry readiness sweep, summary, detail snapshot, reusable validation coverage, and Live Validation waiver handling.

### FB-038 Taskbar / Tray Quick-Task UX And Create Custom Task Surface

- status: `released`
- lane type: `implementation`
- release floor: `patch prerelease`
- target version: `v1.4.1-prebeta`
- release state: `released`
- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.4.1`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-038_taskbar_tray_quick_task_ux.md`
- sequencing note: released the tray quick-task UX milestone, including tray identity/discoverability, tray Open Command Overlay, tray Create Custom Task dialog-open/no-write route, tray-origin create completion through existing FB-036 authoring, catalog reload, exact-match resolution, confirm/result execution, and startup first-visible Core Visualization sequencing repair

## Current Sequencing Reading

Current merged truth indicates:

- the released FB-027 baseline remains part of the locked current interaction floor
- the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-038 tray quick-task UX milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-039 external trigger intake architecture milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-035 lane is closed
- the recent released workstreams above remain part of the locked current baseline
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: no
- FB-038 is released and closed in `v1.4.1-prebeta`; H1 identity/discoverability repair, H2 shortcut-launch tray readback validation, H3 window initialization sequencing, H4 post-fix startup visibility validation, fresh post-H4 technical/live validation, user-facing desktop shortcut validation, and UTS waiver digestion are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-039 is released and closed in `v1.5.0-prebeta`; internal-only intake runtime boundaries, reusable validation coverage, Live Validation waivers, PR readiness governance, and post-merge release-truth repairs are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-040 is released and closed in `v1.6.0-prebeta`; architecture-only monitoring and thermal source mapping, lifecycle/trust-safety framing, validation/admission contract, hardening, Live Validation waiver truth, and post-release canon closure are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-031 is released and closed in `v1.6.1-prebeta`; UI/UX source mapping, visual-language ownership vocabulary, lifecycle/interaction-state framing, future implementation admission contract, hardening, Live Validation waiver truth, PR Readiness merge-target canon, and PR-R1 release-floor validator repair are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-032 is released and closed in `v1.6.2-prebeta`; source-of-truth inventory, naming policy, surface classification, controlled migration admission contract, governance repairs, hardening, Live Validation waivers, and PR Readiness merge-target canon are preserved as historical evidence
- post-release repo truth after the FB-032 release is clear for release debt; FB-004 is selected next on `feature/fb-004-future-boot-orchestrator-layer` but remains Branch Readiness-only and registry-only until admission planning completes
- successor-lane branch creation for FB-039 is historical; FB-039 is released and no longer an executable active implementation branch
- if a branch changes release-facing canon, those canon updates must land on that same branch before PR readiness is allowed
- escaped post-merge canon repair must ride a legal branch surface; `main` is protected and must not be patched directly by Codex
- the released FB-027 baseline does not authorize further saved-action authoring, resolution, voice, Action Studio, routines, profiles, hotkey cleanup, or shutdown-confirmation work by inertia
- remaining future candidate spaces now explicitly recorded in the backlog include:
  - FB-038 for taskbar or tray quick-task UX including Create Custom Task, now released and closed in `v1.4.1-prebeta` with H3/H4 startup visibility re-entry green, `User-Facing Shortcut Validation: PASS`, and UTS handling resolved by documented waiver
  - FB-039 for external trigger and plugin integration architecture, now released and closed in `v1.5.0-prebeta`
  - FB-040 for monitoring, thermals, and performance HUD surfaces, released and closed in `v1.6.0-prebeta`
  - FB-031 for Nexus Desktop AI UI/UX overhaul planning, released and closed in `v1.6.1-prebeta`
  - FB-032 for Nexus-era vision and source-of-truth migration, released and closed in `v1.6.2-prebeta`
  - FB-004 for future boot orchestrator layer, selected next on `feature/fb-004-future-boot-orchestrator-layer` with Branch Readiness still in progress
- those candidate lanes must be selected deliberately rather than bundled together as one implicit interaction continuation
- FB-037 Branch Readiness does not imply automatic continuation into any remaining candidate lane

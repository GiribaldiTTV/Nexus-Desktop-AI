# Nexus Pre-Beta Roadmap

## Purpose

This document is the sequencing and release-posture layer for current Nexus `pre-Beta` planning.

Use it for:

- latest public prerelease truth
- release-debt posture
- current sequencing posture
- recently closed milestone context

Do not use it as:

- a second backlog
- a workstream execution diary
- a substitute for canonical workstream records

## Authority And Boundaries

This roadmap is subordinate to:

- `Docs/development_rules.md`
- `Docs/phase_governance.md`
- `Docs/codex_modes.md`
- `Docs/feature_backlog.md`
- `Docs/workstreams/index.md`
- `Docs/closeout_guidance.md`

That means:

- backlog owns identity
- workstream docs own promoted-work feature-state, branch-local evidence, and closure records
- phase governance owns repo-wide lifecycle, proof, timeout, and stop-loss rules
- closeouts and rebaselines own epoch summaries
- roadmap owns sequencing and release posture only

## Lane Types And Release Fields

Use these lane types:

- `docs-only`
- `implementation`
- `rebaseline`

Use these release-floor values:

- `no release`
- `patch prerelease`
- `minor prerelease`

Use these release-state values when relevant:

- `active delta`
- `merged unreleased`
- `released`
- `closed`

## Current Release Posture

Current merged truth indicates:

- latest public prerelease: `v1.5.0-prebeta`
- latest public release commit: the `v1.5.0-prebeta` tag target
- latest public prerelease publication: `https://github.com/GiribaldiTTV/Nexus-Desktop-AI/releases/tag/v1.5.0-prebeta`
- latest public prerelease title: `Pre-Beta v1.5.0`
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: no
- the latest public released implementation milestone is FB-039 external trigger and plugin integration architecture in `v1.5.0-prebeta`
- current phase after FB-039 release closure: `Live Validation`
- phase status after FB-039 release closure: `Active Branch`
- blocker after release execution: none for FB-039 after this Branch Readiness repair
- current active workstream: FB-040 Monitoring, thermals, and performance HUD surface
- current branch after FB-039 release closure: `feature/fb-040-monitoring-thermals-performance-hud-surface`
- merged-unreleased release-debt owner: none
- next concern: evaluate FB-040 PR Readiness after architecture-only Live Validation completes without widening into runtime monitoring or HUD implementation.

That means the released FB-027 interaction baseline, the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone, the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone, the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone, the released FB-038 tray quick-task UX milestone, and the released FB-039 external trigger intake architecture milestone are now part of the current public shared pre-Beta baseline.

## Current Release Debt Owner

None. FB-039 release debt cleared when `v1.5.0-prebeta` was tagged and published.

## Current Active Workstream

### FB-040 Monitoring, Thermals, And Performance HUD Surface

- status: `Active (Live Validation)`
- record state: `Promoted`
- branch: `feature/fb-040-monitoring-thermals-performance-hud-surface`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-040_monitoring_thermals_performance_hud_surface.md`
- scope: Architecture-first monitoring and thermal source mapping, ownership vocabulary, lifecycle/trust-safety framing, and validation/admission contract definition are complete; Live Validation records that no user-facing or manual validation surface exists for this architecture-only milestone.

## Selected Next Workstream

None selected yet. FB-040 is the active Workstream; successor selection is deferred to FB-040 PR Readiness.

## Most Recent Released Workstream Context

### FB-039 External Trigger And Plugin Integration Architecture

- release state: `released`
- release title: `Pre-Beta v1.5.0`
- canonical workstream doc: `Docs/workstreams/FB-039_external_trigger_plugin_integration_architecture.md`
- sequencing note: released the internal-only external trigger intake architecture milestone, including source map, ownership vocabulary, lifecycle/trust framing, in-memory registration, bounded invocation follow-through, lifecycle transitions, decision evidence, boundary state snapshots, readiness inspection, registry readiness sweep, summary, detail snapshot, reusable validation coverage, and Live Validation waiver handling.

## Prior Released Workstream Context

## Current Sequencing Reading

Current merged truth indicates:

- the released FB-027 baseline remains part of the locked current interaction floor
- the released FB-036 authoring-and-callable-group milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-041 deterministic callable-group execution milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-037 built-in catalog milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-038 tray quick-task UX milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-039 external trigger intake architecture milestone is now part of the locked current pre-Beta baseline
- the released FB-035 lane is closed
- the recent released workstreams above remain part of the locked current baseline
- merged unreleased non-doc implementation debt exists: no
- FB-038 is released and closed in `v1.4.1-prebeta`; H1 identity/discoverability repair, H2 shortcut-launch tray readback validation, H3 window initialization sequencing, H4 post-fix startup visibility validation, fresh post-H4 technical/live validation, user-facing desktop shortcut validation, and UTS waiver digestion are preserved as historical evidence
- FB-039 is released and closed in `v1.5.0-prebeta`; internal-only intake runtime boundaries, reusable validation coverage, Live Validation waivers, PR readiness governance, and post-merge release-truth repairs are preserved as historical evidence
- post-release repo truth after the FB-039 release resolves to no merged-unreleased release-debt blocker
- FB-040 is now in Live Validation on `feature/fb-040-monitoring-thermals-performance-hud-surface`
- successor-lane branch creation for FB-039 is historical; FB-039 is released and no longer an executable active implementation branch
- if a branch changes release-facing canon, those canon updates must land on that same branch before PR readiness is allowed
- escaped post-merge canon repair must ride a legal branch surface; `main` is protected and must not be patched directly by Codex
- the released FB-027 baseline does not authorize further saved-action authoring, resolution, voice, Action Studio, routines, profiles, hotkey cleanup, or shutdown-confirmation work by inertia
- remaining future candidate spaces now explicitly recorded in the backlog include:
  - FB-038 for taskbar or tray quick-task UX including Create Custom Task, now released and closed in `v1.4.1-prebeta` with H3/H4 startup visibility re-entry green, `User-Facing Shortcut Validation: PASS`, and UTS handling resolved by documented waiver
  - FB-039 for external trigger and plugin integration architecture, now released and closed in `v1.5.0-prebeta`
  - FB-040 for monitoring, thermals, and performance HUD surfaces, active in Workstream on `feature/fb-040-monitoring-thermals-performance-hud-surface`
- those candidate lanes must be selected deliberately rather than bundled together as one implicit interaction continuation
- FB-037 Branch Readiness does not imply automatic continuation into any remaining candidate lane

Use canonical workstream docs for execution detail.
Use the backlog for item identity.
